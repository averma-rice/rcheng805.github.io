collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This paper analyzes muscle activity of patients with complete spinal cord injury (SCI) versus healthy subjects, and how motor training modifies the muscle activity. It examines what features of the muscle activity are important for good functional behavior in SCI, and how motor training influences these features.'

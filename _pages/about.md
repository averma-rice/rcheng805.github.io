I am currently pursuing my PhD at Caltech, working with Prof. Joel Burdick and Prof. Richard Murray. My research focuses on (1) improving reliability and efficiency of reinforcement learning applied to robot planning and control, and (2) guaranteeing safety of robotic systems under learned predictive models. I'm interested in developing machine learning algorithms that leverage model information about robotic systems to ensure safe and reliable operation.

For a short summary of my past work/experiences, you can find my resume [here](https://rcheng805.github.io/files/Caltech_Resume_08_20_v1.pdf).

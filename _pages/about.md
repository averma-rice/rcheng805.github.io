I am a PhD student at the California Institute of Technology working with Joel Burdick and Richard Murray. I'm currently studying reinforcement learning and its applications to both robot control and neural rehabilitation. I'm interested in developing machine learning algorithms that can leverage model information or domain knowledge about a system to guide learning.

I received my bachelors in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University in 2015 with minors in Computer Science and Robotics/Intelligent Systems.

For a short summary of my past work/experiences, you can find my resume [here](https://rcheng805.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

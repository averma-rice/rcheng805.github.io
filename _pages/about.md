I am a PhD student at the California Institute of Technology in the Mechanical and Civil Engineering department. I'm currently studying reinforcement learning and its applications to both robot control and neural rehabilitation. I'm interested in developing learning algorithms that can leverage model information or previously existing knowledge about the system to guide exploration.

For a short summary of my past work/experiences, you can find my resume [here](https://rcheng805.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
